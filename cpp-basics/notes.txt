instead of #include<iostream>, 
    we can use #include <bits/stdc++.h> also, to get all the lib at once. It's a shortcut that includes a vast number of standard C++ libraries, making it easier to access a wide range of functions and classes without specifying each library individually.

Range of values of integer DataTypes:
1. Int (4 bytes) -> (-10^9 to 10^9)
2. long  -> (-10^12 to 10^12)
3. long long -> (-10^18 to 10^18)

Similarly, to store decimal numbers: float < double 
< long double

ARRAY:
- stores homogenous DataTypes
- starts from 0 index
- each index value cn be modified
- elements are stored in consecutive memory address

FUNCTION:
- used to modularize code
- increases readability
- to use same code multiple times
